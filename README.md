# Leetcode Exercises Repository

This repository contains my solutions to Leetcode exercises, focusing on algorithms and data structures.

### Folder Structure

I'm currently working through the [Leetcode Beginner's Guide](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/the-leetcode-beginners-guide/). Each solution is organized by exercise name:

```
beginners_guide/
├── name_of_exercise/
└── Solution.java
```

### Goal

My goal is to improve problem-solving skills in a fun way by practicing algorithms and data structures on Leetcode.

Feel free to explore the solutions and share feedback of improvements
